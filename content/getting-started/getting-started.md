# II: Getting Started

## Tools we're going to need
In order to create our Sails.js application we're going to need a few tools - namely [Node.js](#installing-node-js), [Sails.js](#installing-sails-js) itself, [NPM](#installing-node-js) _(the node package manager)_, and an [IDE or Text Editor](#choosing-an-ide).

You will also need to be comfortable working with a command-line or terminal interface - you know those black-and-white matrix-looking screens that hackers on TV use. It's really not that daunting once you get the hang of it (you might even find you like it more than clicking and double clicking all day).

## Installing Node.js
Of course, in order to run our Sails.js application, first we're going to need to install Node.js!

## Basic terminal blah blah
OSX and most Linux distributions come with a solid terminal experience out of the box. Windows users, while you can use `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell`, there are a few other options that will be discussed later on.

## Installing Sails.js
Double check that Node.js and npm are installed - running `node -v` and `npm -v` should tell you the version of each respectively. Then we can install the `sails` command line tool by running
```bash
npm install -g sails
```

::: warning
Under OSX and Linux you may encounter a "permissions issue" when running the above `npm install` command. If you do, you can either run `sudo npm install -g sails` on OSX or Linux, or try [fixing your NPM permissions]().

## Choosing an IDE
While it's more than possible for you to write your entire application using tools like Windows' Notepad application, you're probably going to want to find yourself an ___IDE___, or _Integrated Development Enviroment_, to use while writing your code.
For those not in the know, an IDE is basically a text editor with some extra bells and whistles to help make writing, testing and debugging code easier. 

Some popular free code editors and IDEs include:
- Atom
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- ...?

I personally prefer to use WebStorm (the IntelliJ guys make good stuff!) while writing node/JS applications, but it comes with quite a price tag. Any of the above tools (or any number o)
